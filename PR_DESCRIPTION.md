### Summary

This PR refactors the project structure by migrating service-level functionality from the `utils/` directory to the `services/` directory to improve code organization and maintainability.

### Migrated Files

| Original Path | New Path | Description |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| `utils/analyticsMonitor.js` | `services/analyticsMonitor.js` | Analytics monitoring service |
| `utils/asyncProcessor.js` | `services/asyncProcessor.js` | Async processing service |
| `utils/googleTranslate.js` | `services/googleTranslate.js` | Google Translate API service |
| `utils/maintenance.js` | `services/maintenanceScheduler.js` | Maintenance scheduler (renamed) |
| `utils/recommendationScheduler.js` | `services/recommendationScheduler.js` | Recommendation system scheduler |
| `utils/notificationScheduler.js` | `services/notificationScheduler.js` | Notification scheduler service |
| `utils/userCleanupScheduler.js` | `services/userCleanupScheduler.js` | User cleanup scheduler |

### Changes Made

- ✅ Successfully migrated 7 service files
- ✅ Updated all related import paths (10+ files)
- ✅ Updated test files and mock paths
- ✅ Added comprehensive migration documentation
- ✅ Updated README with new project structure

### Test Results

- ✅ All import paths resolve correctly
- ✅ Service loading tests pass
- ✅ No circular dependency issues
- ✅ Integration tests pass
- ✅ System startup tests pass

### New Project Structure

```
services/
├── analyticsMonitor.js      # Analytics monitoring service
├── asyncProcessor.js        # Async processing service
├── emailService.js          # Email service
├── googleTranslate.js       # Google Translate service
├── logService.js            # Logging service
├── maintenanceScheduler.js  # Maintenance scheduler
